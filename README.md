# CMPSC 473: Operating Systems Design & Construction  

## Overview  
This repository contains my coursework, programming assignments, and related materials for **CMPSC 473: Operating Systems Design & Construction** at **Penn State University**.  
The course focused on the design and implementation of operating systems, emphasizing how software interacts with hardware to manage resources such as **processes, memory, storage, and I/O devices**.  

All programming assignments were implemented in **C** on a **Linux** environment, using tools like **GDB** for debugging and analysis.

## Repository Contents  
- **Programming Assignments**  
  - **Pointer Assignment:** Practiced pointer manipulation and memory addressing.  
  - **Malloc Implementation (Checkpoints and Final):** Built a custom dynamic memory allocator to manage heap memory.  
  - **Concurrency:** Developed multithreaded programs with synchronization primitives like mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables.  
  - **Scheduling:** Implemented CPU scheduling algorithms and evaluated their performance metrics.  

- **Homework Assignments**  
  - Explored CPU management, virtual memory, and storage systems.

## Tools and Environment  
- **Language:** C  
- **Operating System:** Linux (via Virtual Machine)  
- **Debugger:** GDB  
- **Build Tools:** Makefiles, GCC, Shell scripting

## Topics Covered  
- Process creation, scheduling, and context switching  
- Memory management, paging, and virtual memory design  
- Synchronization and concurrency (mutexes, semaphores, condition variables)  
- Filesystem organization and I/O driver stack  
- System calls, interrupts, and kernel-level execution

## What I Learned  
Through this course, I gained hands-on experience with **system-level programming** and **operating system internals**.  
Key takeaways include:  
- Designing and implementing **memory allocators** and **schedulers** from scratch.  
- Understanding how operating systems manage **processes, threads, and synchronization**.  
- Debugging and optimizing **concurrent C programs** using **GDB**.  
- Gaining a deeper understanding of **virtual memory systems**, **page tables**, and **kernel-user transitions**.  
- Building confidence in writing **efficient and safe low-level C code**.
